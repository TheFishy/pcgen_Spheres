# pcgen_Spheres
Spheres of Power, Spheres of might, and champions of the spheres is an alternative set of rules for play in pathfinder table top rpg. Herolab has tools for creating characters using this, and I think it's high time pcgen got it too. nobody else seemed to be working on it, so I'm going to get started on it.

[the link for the wiki is here](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/)
If anyone else reads this and decides they want to help, the basic idea is to create the list's and functions that will be used by PCgen to create a character in spheres. All the source material can be found in the wiki.
